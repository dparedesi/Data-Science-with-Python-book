# Introduction to Large Language Models

## What are LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.

## Key Concepts

### Transformer Architecture
Modern LLMs use the transformer architecture, which processes text in parallel rather than sequentially.

### Tokens
LLMs process text as tokens (word pieces), not individual characters or words.

### Context Window
The maximum amount of text the model can process at once.

## Major LLM Providers

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, GPT-3.5
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3
- **Google**: Gemini
- **Meta**: Llama
- **Mistral**: Mixtral

## Use Cases

1. **Text Generation**: Writing assistance, content creation
2. **Summarization**: Condensing long documents
3. **Translation**: Language translation
4. **Code Generation**: Programming assistance
5. **Question Answering**: Information retrieval
6. **Analysis**: Data interpretation and insights

## Getting Started

```{python}
#| eval: false
# Install the OpenAI package
# pip install openai

from openai import OpenAI
import os

# Set up the client
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
```

## Ethical Considerations

- **Bias**: LLMs can reflect biases in training data
- **Hallucinations**: Models may generate plausible but incorrect information
- **Privacy**: Be careful with sensitive data
- **Attribution**: AI-generated content should be disclosed

## What's Next

In the following chapters, we'll learn:
- How to use LLM APIs
- Working with embeddings
- Building applications with LLMs
