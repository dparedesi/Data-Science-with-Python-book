# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Learning from labeled data to make predictions:
- **Classification**: Predicting categorical outcomes
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values

### Unsupervised Learning
Finding patterns in unlabeled data:
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar observations
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing features while preserving information

### Reinforcement Learning
Learning through interaction with an environment.

## The Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering relevant data
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features
4. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms
5. **Training**: Fitting the model to data
6. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance
7. **Deployment**: Putting the model into production

## scikit-learn: The ML Toolkit

```{python}
#| eval: true
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load example dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42
)

print(f"Training samples: {len(X_train)}")
print(f"Test samples: {len(X_test)}")
```

## Key Concepts

### Training and Test Sets
- **Training set**: Data used to train the model
- **Test set**: Data used to evaluate model performance

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- **Overfitting**: Model learns noise, poor generalization
- **Underfitting**: Model too simple, misses patterns

### Cross-Validation
Technique to assess model generalization by splitting data into multiple folds.

## What's Next
