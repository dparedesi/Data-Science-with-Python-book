# Real-World Case Studies Introduction

## Overview

In this section, we apply data science techniques to real-world problems. Each case study demonstrates a complete workflow from data collection to insights.

## What You'll Learn

- **Real Estate Analysis**: Analyzing property markets using data
- **Google Analytics**: Understanding web traffic patterns
- **End-to-end workflows**: From data to actionable insights

## Skills Applied

These case studies integrate skills from previous chapters:

1. **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and transforming messy data
2. **Visualization**: Creating insightful plots
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Testing hypotheses
4. **Machine Learning**: Building predictive models

## Tools Used

```{python}
#| eval: true
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

## Case Study Approach

Each case follows this structure:

1. **Problem Definition**: What question are we answering?
2. **Data Collection**: Where does the data come from?
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Understanding the data
4. **Model Building**: Creating solutions
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing results
6. **Conclusions**: What did we learn?

Let's dive into the case studies!
