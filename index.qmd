# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to *Data Science with Python*!

In an era where data-driven decisions shape industries from healthcare to finance, mastering Python gives you the power to extract insights, build predictive models, and communicate findings effectively. This book has evolved from personal learning notes into a comprehensive resource that takes you from fundamentals to advanced data science techniques using practical, hands-on exercises.

This book is designed for beginners with no prior Python experience who want a structured path into data science, as well as analysts looking to upgrade from spreadsheets to reproducible Python workflows. It also serves students, professionals, and practitioners seeking to modernize their machine learning skills with scikit-learn. Basic familiarity with statistics concepts is helpful but not required, as all code examples are self-contained and explained step-by-step.

This book reflects the latest developments in the Python ecosystem. We use Python 3.11+ along with modern tools like VS Code and Jupyter notebooks. The book covers modern pandas patterns including method chaining, comprehensive data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn, and machine learning with scikit-learn. We have also included entirely new topics such as Generative AI and LLM integration with Python, AI-assisted coding workflows, ethics in data science, and enhanced text processing with NLTK and spaCy.

Each chapter builds on previous concepts, but you can also jump to topics of interest. If you are learning Python from scratch, start with the Fundamentals in the first two chapters. Chapter 3 covers visualization with matplotlib and seaborn, while Chapter 12 dives into building machine learning models. For those interested in working with Large Language Models, Chapter 14 covers Generative AI. Throughout the book, you will find hands-on exercises to test your understanding. Solutions are provided, but we encourage you to try them yourself first.

Many exercises are inspired by practical classroom experiences and activities from the [Professional Certificate in Data Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science)^[https://online-learning.harvard.edu/series/professional-certificate-data-science] by **HarvardX**. The code used to generate this book is available on GitHub, encouraging transparency and reproducibility.
