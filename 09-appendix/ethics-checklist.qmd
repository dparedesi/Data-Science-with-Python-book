# Ethics Checklist for Data Science

## Introduction

Ethical considerations are fundamental to responsible data science practice.

## The Ethics Checklist

### Data Collection

- [ ] Is data collection transparent?
- [ ] Do we have consent for data use?
- [ ] Are we collecting only necessary data?
- [ ] Is data collection equitable across groups?

### Data Storage

- [ ] Is data stored securely?
- [ ] Are access controls in place?
- [ ] Is personally identifiable information (PII) protected?
- [ ] Do we have a data retention policy?

### Model Development

- [ ] Have we tested for bias in training data?
- [ ] Are all demographic groups fairly represented?
- [ ] Have we considered potential misuse?
- [ ] Is the model interpretable/explainable?

### Deployment

- [ ] Can users opt out of automated decisions?
- [ ] Is there human oversight for critical decisions?
- [ ] Are model limitations clearly communicated?
- [ ] Is there a feedback mechanism?

### Monitoring

- [ ] Do we monitor for model drift?
- [ ] Are we tracking fairness metrics over time?
- [ ] Is there a process for addressing issues?
- [ ] Do we conduct regular ethics reviews?

## Common Biases in ML

1. **Selection Bias**: Training data not representative
2. **Confirmation Bias**: Seeking patterns that confirm beliefs
3. **Measurement Bias**: Systematic errors in data collection
4. **Historical Bias**: Encoding past discrimination
5. **Aggregation Bias**: Assuming all groups behave similarly

## Fairness Metrics

```{python}
#| eval: true
import numpy as np

def demographic_parity(y_pred, sensitive_attr):
    """Check if prediction rates are equal across groups."""
    rates = {}
    for group in np.unique(sensitive_attr):
        mask = sensitive_attr == group
        rates[group] = np.mean(y_pred[mask])
    return rates

# Example
np.random.seed(42)
predictions = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)
groups = np.random.choice(['A', 'B'], 100)

print("Prediction rates by group:")
print(demographic_parity(predictions, groups))
```

## Privacy-Preserving Techniques

- **Differential Privacy**: Adding noise to protect individuals
- **Federated Learning**: Training without centralizing data
- **Data Anonymization**: Removing identifying information
- **Synthetic Data**: Generating artificial but realistic data
